Theta Tau Mu Gamma: Pledge Coding Project 
I. Assignment 
The software engineers of Psi Beta Pledge Class are to develop an iOS app for the Mu Gamma chapter. 
Prerequisites include the completion of shop safety training 
http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/machineshopsafety/ 

II. Preface 
The members of Psi Beta are continuing to foster social bonds through their sixth week of pledging. Psi Beta’s ability to mobilize to work towards a common goal will be assessed by the development of the app. The craftsmanship and attention to detail of their work will be a metaphor representative of traits that make outstanding brothers and engineers. 

III. Constraints and Requirements 
Create an App Design Process outlining task delegation and scheduling of tasks (To-Do List).  
Required Tabs/Pages:
Home: Information regarding the founding of Theta Tau and the Mu Gamma Chapter. It must have the purpose of Theta Tau and the open motto. The Pillars of the fraternity must be mentioned (Professionalism, Brotherhood, Community Service)
Brotherhood: Each brother must be highlighted in this tab. Name and picture must be included in this tab. When the picture is clicked/tab a new page shall appear giving a brief description of the brother using facts collected from interviews (Keep this professional, and if the brother has an internship or signed a full time offer make sure to talk about this, so follow up on brothers).
Eboard has to have its own section in the top of the tab. Profile must be labeled with the position they hold in the fraternity.
Brotherhood must be sectioned into Pledge Class in which they cross in chronological order. 
Rush Tab: Have the rush events from this semester on here. Include pictures from rush and the schedules. Give brief descriptions of the rush events here.
Suggestions:
Use images, headings, readable fonts, and a nice color palette to ensure the website's appearance is easy to read and professionally put together.
No outside help is allowed. All work must be done by pledges of the Psi Beta pledge class. 



IV. Design Process 
As engineers, our job is to be as efficient as possible. As a pledge class, you will achieve efficiency by laying out and designing your fabrication process with great detail. With a well thought-out design, there is no reason this project should take more than one trial on any step to complete. All pledges will be required to pull their weight of the effort in some way shape or form. Delegate tasks within the pledge class based on skills, availability, and resources. Assigning these tasks with a time deadline as part of a rigid schedule will help the fabrication process finish smoothly and on-time.

V. Communication 
Communication is another key element in completing tasks efficiently and effectively. The class should emphasize communication to each other with these fields: task and stage completions, delays, problems, locations, and need for assistance (i.e., “YOU’RE NOT HELPING OUT ENOUGH”). Not only is communication important within a pledge class, but it is also important to establish a fluent communication method with your marshals. We want updates on how things are going, so we are expecting to be updated regularly on several specifics. 

VI. Deliverables 
Discord updates throughout the project process as such: 
When the layout/outline of the app is put together. 
When each page/tab is completed.
When the entire app is completed.

Design Process outlining task delegation, scheduling of tasks (To-Do List)
All Pledges working on the project are responsible to pull their own weight. Pledge class officers must ensure the completion of the above documentation

Developed App
Refer to section III for specifications 

Presentation/Photos 
Photos shall be taken throughout the process 
PowerPoint slides shall be put together and ready to be presented 

VII. Deadlines 
Comprehensive plans should be put together and presented by two representatives from the  pledge class by Thursday 4/6
Final version of the app must be presented by Monday 3/24

VIII. Remarks 
This is your opportunity to showcase your dynamic to work as a team. We are asking you, as a pledge class, to create something that you are proud and confident enough to present to others. All pledge classes before Psi Beta have developed their projects and recognized it as a symbol of pride. Psi Beta shall carry on this legacy; we expect nothing but the best.
